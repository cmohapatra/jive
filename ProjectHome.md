# JIVE:  Java Interactive Visualization Environment #

JIVE is an interactive execution environment for Eclipse that supports a declarative and visual approach to debugging object-oriented software.  It can also serve as a pedagogic tool for teaching object-oriented programming.  JIVE extends Eclipse's Java debugging facilities with interactive visualization, query-based debugging, and reverse stepping.

JIVE is developed by the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/) at the [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu/).  It is released under the [Eclipse Public License (EPL)](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) agreement.
